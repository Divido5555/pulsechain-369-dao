# PulseChain 369 DAO Suite

> Hybrid governance system for Family → Company → Township evolution, built on PulseChain.


## 🤝 Open Call for Collaborators & Partners

This project was built by a solo founder to solve a real problem: how to launch a DAO on PulseChain with true founder-first control, treasury security, and a path to decentralization.

If you're a:

- 🔧 Developer who enjoys debugging or extending smart contracts
- 🪙 PulseChain project that wants to use this DAO suite
- 💼 Team looking to build town or family-based governance models

…I’d love to connect.

👉 Message me on X @magicfock or open an Issue on this repo if you'd like to contribute, partner, or test it live.

No pressure — just publishing what I’ve built and seeing who wants to build from here.


## 🤝 Maintainer Handoff
This project is complete and modular. You can:
- Plug in a DAO dashboard frontend
- Add Stripe/fiat onramp integrations
- Expand board elections logic
- Add vesting, staking, or NFT roles
